## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I proplerly styled the application into its final appearance

- **Header,footer, and main content body**
- **Navigation elements**
  - The styling for navigation elements changes when hovering over them, and when switching inbetween tabs
- **Responsive to window resizing**
  - The app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- **Application elements**
  - Used good contrast and whitespace
- **Application text content**
  - Consistent fonts

  - Background image floats

## React Phase 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.
- Bundled using Vite 
- NailEdit now boasts a modular React codebase.
- React components facilitate easier maintenance and future feature expansion.

  - **Component-Based Architecture:**  
    The original HTML pages have been divided into modular React components:
  - **Login Component:** Handles user authentication with a form for login and sign-up.
  - **MyAccount Component:** Provides a workspace for creating and editing nail designs, featuring a random color generator and HEX code input.
  - **Explore Component:** Displays nail designs from other users with like buttons that update realtime.
  - **ExistingNails Component:** Allows users to view, save, and delete nail designs from their personal collection.

- **Routing with React Router:**  
  Client-side routing is managed through React Router, resulting in a smooth single-page application (SPA) experience. Users can navigate seamlessly between Login, MyAccount, Explore, and ExistingNails without full page reloads.

- **Enhanced Styling & Layout:**  
  The original CSS has been adapted for React and integrated within the component hierarchy. A flexbox-based layout ensures that:
  - The header remains at the top.
  - The main content area fills available space.
  - A sticky footer is automatically pushed to the bottom on pages with little content (without using fixed positioning).

## React Phase 2: Reactivity Deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React to ensure the application is fully functional for a single user. I have also added placeholders for future technology.

### My Account (myAccount.jsx)
- Uses a helper function to generate a random hex code (simulating a third‚Äìparty API call).
- On component mount (inside a `useEffect`), it ‚Äúfetches‚Äù an initial hex code.
- The **Random** and **Custom** buttons let the user update the displayed hex code.
- The **Save** button stores the current design (hex color) to localStorage so that the **Existing Nails** view can later load it.

### Explore (explore.jsx)
- Refactored into a parent component composed of two child components:
  - **LiveMessages:** Uses a `useEffect` hook with `setInterval` to simulate a WebSocket that every few seconds ‚Äúreceives‚Äù a like message from a random user. It displays the latest five messages.
  - **ExploreNails:** Displays nail designs for three sample users. The like button increments a local like counter on click.

### Login (login.jsx)
- Implements two child components that render based on the authentication state:
  - **Unauthenticated:** Shows a login form. On a mock login (when username and password are provided), the username is stored in localStorage and reported back up via a callback.
  - **Authenticated:** Welcomes the user and displays a **Sign Out** button which clears localStorage, updates the state, and ‚Äúlogs out‚Äù the user.
- Also includes an optional **MessageDialog** component for error handling (handled simply in this deliverable).

### App (app.jsx)
- Lifts the authentication state (`authState` and `username`) into the top‚Äìlevel component so that other parts of the app (and even the navigation menu) can react to login changes.
- Checks localStorage on startup and conditionally renders either **Log In** or **Sign Out** in the menu.

### Existing Nails (existingNails.jsx)
- Reads a list of saved designs from localStorage and displays each one, rendering nails with their saved hex code.

## Service Deliverable

This deliverable implements a comprehensive backend service for NailEdit using Node.js and Express, offering secure authentication, integration with third-party endpoints, and dedicated backend endpoints that power the React frontend.


- **Node.js/Express HTTP Service:**  
  The service is built on Node.js and Express, and listens on a specified port (defaulting to 4000). It provides RESTful endpoints for user registration, login, logout, nail design management, and a proxy for a third-party color service.

- **Static Middleware for Frontend:**  
  The Express static middleware serves the React frontend from the `public` directory. This integration ensures that the entire application (backend and frontend) runs as a single unified service.

- **Third-Party API Integration:**  
  The backend leverages `node-fetch` to proxy requests to [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/). By calling the endpoint with `hex=random`, the service always returns a random color, eliminating the need to generate a hex code locally.

#### Authentication Endpoints

- **Register:**  
  **`POST /api/auth/create`**  
  Registers a new user after ensuring that the email is not already in use. The password is securely hashed using `bcryptjs` and the user receives a token stored as an HTTP-only cookie.

- **Login:**  
  **`POST /api/auth/login`**  
  Authenticates an existing user by validating the credentials. On success, the system issues a new session token (via UUID) and sets it in a secure cookie.

- **Logout:**  
  **`DELETE /api/auth/logout`**  
  Logs out the user by removing their session token from the in-memory store and clearing the authentication cookie.


#### Nail Design Endpoints

- **Saved Designs (Private):**  
  - **`POST /api/designs/saved`**  
    Saves a nail design (color) for the authenticated user.
  - **`GET /api/designs/saved`**  
    Retrieves the saved designs for the logged-in user.
  - **`DELETE /api/designs/saved/:id`**  
    Deletes a specific design if it belongs to the authenticated user.

- **Posted Designs (Public):**  
  - **`POST /api/designs/posted`**  
    Allows an authenticated user to post a design publicly.
  - **`GET /api/designs/posted`**  
    Retrieves all publicly posted nail designs.

#### Third-Party Color API Proxy

- **Random Color Endpoint:**  
  **`GET /api/color`**  
  This endpoint proxies a request to The Color API by calling it with `hex=random&format=json`. The result is forwarded to the client and used to display a random color on the frontend.
